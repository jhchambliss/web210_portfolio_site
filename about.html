                <p>Jackie Chambliss is a career-transition developer. She has spent numerous years in the restaurant industry in a handful of different roles, but she’s usually happiest when she is behind the bar. This being said, her last position as the Director of Training for a local restaurant group had been a dream job, and it inadvertently paved the way for new dreams. When vetting multiple SaaS products for that company, she noticed a lot of repetitive themes. “No Android support. iPads only.” “No mobile app and the website isn’t responsively designed.” “We can’t change that. That’s just how the developers made it.” “I’m not sure. I’ll have to ask.” “I’m not sure. I’ll have to ask.” “I’m not sure. I’ll have to ask.” It turned out that people selling these products didn’t know very much about either how they worked or how the end user actually needed them to work. She felt like there had to be a better way. This is where Jackie has always excelled – finding a way or finding a better way.</p>
