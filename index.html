                <p>"Drag and Drop" web design is so common these days. It's the meal delivery service of online presence, and like meal delivery kits, it has a time and a place. The question is, do you want to feed your customers the way someone else tells you to, or do you want to ...</p>

                <p>Whether flexing analytical skills in the technical realms of mobile and web development or the visual skills of web design and UI/UX, there is always an element of creativity involved. That little spark of magic!</p>
                <p>Which is something I personally learned to hone in my years behind the bar crafting custom cocktails for various companies and events, so while not directly relevant to your personal design and development needs, it's always fun to find a little something unexpected in the mix :)</p>

                    <h3>"Who Would Win"</h3>
                    <p>"Who Would Win" pits two contestants against each other. Animal, vegetable, or mineral. Superheros, co-workers, living room furniture. The user assigns three variables upon which the contestants will be judged and can determine if any of these variables are more valuable than others. And let the best taco win!</p>
                    <p>The desire to be able to build this product is what put me on the path back to school. From this nascent idea in the fall 0f 2019, I went from no programming or design experience to deciding to detour a graduate school plan in January of 2020 in order to learn how to build this program.</p>
                    <p>I submitted this Android app as my final project for my Android Mobile Development certificate in December that same year.</p>

                    <p>The challenge was to plan, design, and develop a website visitors could use while at Biltmore Estates. While some tablets are the size of small laptops these days, the core group of users would be accessing the site from their phones.</p>
                    <p>The most interesting part of this project was figuring out how to make the site engaging and useful, without being overwhelming. By focusing on the idea that visitors to Biltmore Estates are often eager to learn about things, one of the main focuses of the site is the self guided tours section. However, to keep the user engaged ... and in the site ... a place to upload pictures to a daily photo feed is one of the main features on the home screen.</p>

                    <h3>Designing with Personas</h3>
                    <p>Not all people want the same type of product even if it might seem like they should.</p>
                    <p>A fledgling photographer at the ripe age of 8 is a very different type of user than a fledgling photographer at the ripe age of 19. Their environments, life experiences, and even desired end results can vary.</p>
                    <p>The Photo Explorer app was designed for youths interested in photography from an observational point of view. They want to record and preserve the things they see around them. Tripod+ provides users with a sleek interface that feels professional, but still provides adequate technical guidance to those still learning the ropes. It is more focused on teaching the user how to use the tool (aka the camera) to capture the vision.</p>
